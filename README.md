Face Mask😷 Detection using TensorFlow

What you need to do for run my project.
First you need to download TensorFlow Object Detection API 
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/r1.13.0
Go to the master/research/object_detection and paste all files & folders of my repository to there.
Then you can execute Object_detection_video.py, image or webcam.

If you want to train your own model i putted images that i used for training.
You can use any model that you wanna use for training. 
I used Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2-COCO
It took 10.000 steps(4 hour) to train. 
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md

If you want to use my labelled images(xml files) your directory must be like C:\tensorflow1\models\research\object_detection.
